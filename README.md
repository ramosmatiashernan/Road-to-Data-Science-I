# Road to Data Science I (Regression Problem)

In this project, a machine learning regression model has been developed to predict IGN scores for video games based on features such as genre, release year, launch platform, and potential score phrases such as 'Good' or 'Bad,' which could be provided by different video game reviewers.

The database has been explored and, based on some logical assumptions, it has been cleaned and preprocessed for model training.

The dataset used was provided by Alexander Kapturov, accessible at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/ign-games-from-best-to-worst/data.
