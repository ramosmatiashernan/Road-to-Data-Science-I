# Road to Data Science I (Regression Problem)

In this project, it is created a machine learning regression model that predict the IGN score for a videogame based on features like the genre of the game, the year of release, the platform where it was launched and a possible score prhase like "Good", "Bad", etc, that could be extracted for example, from another reviewer of videogames.

The database is explored and based on some logical assumptions, it is cleaned and preprocessed for model training.

The database was extracted from ALEXANDER KAPTUROV (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/ign-games-from-best-to-worst/data)
